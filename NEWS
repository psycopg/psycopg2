psycopg news for 1.1.15
-----------------------

* Interval typecasting eventually-eventually works the Right Way (TM).

* Fixed two bad memory leaks in QuotedString and Binary objects.

* Reverted change on rowcount attribute, now it is always set to the real
  number of affected columns.

psycopg news for 1.1.14
-----------------------

* Interval typecasting eventually works the Right Way (TM).

* ZPsycopgDA now support unicode strings and different backend encodings.

* ZPsycopgDA accept query data as an extra parameter to execute() (but
  still no way to give it extra data from inside a ZSQL Method.)

* Better DBAPI-2.0 compliance (rowcount attribute and argument passing.)

* Now builds on Fedora Core 2 (but remember that the real psycopg
  aficionado runs on Debian ;-P )

* COPY FROM raise an exception and return usefull information on error.

psycopg news for 1.1.13
-----------------------

* ZPsycopgDA works again.

psycopg news for 1.1.12
-----------------------

* Fixed nasty segfault/deadlock in switch_isolation_level.

* Now the PostgreSQL TIME type is correctly converted to a DateTimeDelta
  instead of a DateTime. This is much better because you can now add two
  times and a time and a date.

* Added an "sslmode" parameter (look at PostgreSQL documentation for
  possible values.)

* .execute() now rise the right exception if called with a wrong
   tuple/dict. Also, %% in queries does not raise an exception anymore.

* Updated RPM specs (thanks to Mark McClain we now have updated RPMs on
  initd.org too.)

psycopg news for 1.1.11
-----------------------

* a modern autoconf is now needed to build psycopg.

* now an error during commit or rollback is correctly reported by raising 
  an exception.

* when the libpq protocol 3.0 is available, psycopg uses a smater method
  to determine exception type (unfortunately the old string compare method
  is still neede for postgresql <= 7.3.x.)

* plugged a memory leak in copy_from().

* where did the news for 1.1.10 go?

psycopg news for 1.1.9
----------------------

* psycopg distribution now includes the GeoTypes package by Richard Taylor
  (QinetiQ Plc)!

* Problems with sequences and mappings non correctly used in .execute()
  should be gone (mogrification code completely rewritten.) Many thanks
  to Richard Taylor and Vsevolod Lobko that helped by testing the "pre"
  releases.

* no more libpq 7.1.x linking problems related to PQfreeNotify.

psycopg news for 1.1.7
----------------------

* added notifies and fileno methods to cursor objects.

* now execute accept any object that defined __getitem__ and not only
  dictionaries.

* little fix in ZPsycopgDA, should work with Zope 2.7.

psycopg news for 1.1.6
----------------------

* cursor objects now have the .scroll() method.

* NUL characters in strings are discarded in quoting; use a Binary object if
  you need strings with embedded NULs.

* Fixed another MT problem in .execute().

psycopg news for 1.1.5
----------------------

* ZPsycopgDA now rollback before raising an exception; should be a backward
  compatible change for people that really want to continue executing queries
  after an exception.

* fixed problem with dictionary mogrification (i.e., specifying the same key
  multiple times and having the None value in the dict should work now.)

* fixed keeper status trashing problem: no more psycopg stuck in transaction
  (maybe this will also solve ZPsycopgDA problems: will see...)

* now copy_from and copy_to can be passed instances of classes with "readline"
  and "write" methods and not only file instances.
 
psycopg news for 1.1.4
----------------------

* Fixed various memory leak problems.

* Implemented "statusmessage" attribute on cursors.

psycopg news for 1.1.3
----------------------

* Fixed problem with psycopg always reporting IntegrityError.

* Fixed segfault in debug statements.

* Now Python GIL is unlocked during PQconnectdb() calls (better
  multithreading.)

psycopg news for 1.1.2
----------------------

* Skipped version 1.1.1 (never released 'cause of a cvs tag error)

* Much better cursor.description fields (many thanks to William K. Volkman)

* psycopg.connect() now takes keyword parameters for host, dbname, port,
  user and password (they are all strings, even "port".)

* connection.set_isolation_level() implemented to help switching from default
  isolation to other levels supported by PostgreSQL. [autocommit now simply 
  does a set_isolation_level(0)]

* Implemented .lastrowid attribute for cursors.

* Now psycopg should build on win32/cygwin, thank to Hajime Nakagami patches.

* Includes every fix from 1.0.x up to 1.0.15.1:

  - Fixed connection-stay-open-when-i-do-conn.close() bug.
  - Better DBAPI-2.0 compliance for setinputsizes and setoutputsize methods.
  - Better support for build on MacOS X.
  - Fixed problem with formats in string mogrification.
  - Fixed other miscellaneous buglets in Zope Adapter.
  - Fixed small memory leak in .fetchXXX() methods.
  - Fixed serialization problem in ZPsycopgDA reported by Dieter Maurer.

psycopg news for 1.1
--------------------

* COPY TO/COPY FROM implemented by Tom Jenkins

* Merged changes from 1.0.13.

psycopg news for 1.0.12
-----------------------

* Maintenance release fixing some little buglets:
  - Fixed memory leak in .execute().
  - Better configure under MacOS X.
  - DA-browser now works even with tables with mixed-case names.
  - timestamps time is now set to correct value instead of 0. 

psycopg news for 1.0.11.1
-------------------------

* Fixed orrible bug in ZPsycopgDA not acception psycopg 1.0.11 as a valid
  version.

psycopg news for 1.0.11
-----------------------

* last problems from "None passed to typecasters" (introduced in 1.0.9) in
  ZPsycopgDA solved (hopefully.)

* psycopg now reports meaningfull exception types for some errors (like
  IntegrityError for duplicate insertions in unique indices, etc.)

psycopg news for 1.0.10
-----------------------

* fixed an exception problem introduced in 1.0.9 (patch by Matt 
  Hoskins.)

* ZPsycopgDA now checks psycopg version and raise an exception if it
  does not match.

psycopg news for 1.0.9
----------------------

* fixed problem with connection left in invalid state by applying
  Tom Jenkins patch.

* None values passed to the typecasters, it is now possible to
  translate None into "" to achieve pygrsql compatibilty. 

* applied 'seconds as a float' patch from Jelle.

psycopg news for 1.0.8
----------------------

* fixed a segfault introduced in 1.0.7 and another little bug when
  dealing with empty strings in QuotedString objects.

* Added win32 compatibility (many many thanks to Jason Erickson).

psycopg news for 1.0.7
----------------------

* Fixed little bugs in type management (infinity problems and the
  TIMESTAMPTZ type) and Zope import. Better configure script.

* Now psycopg really close the physical connection to PostgreSQL on
  connection .close().

psycopg news for 1.0.5
----------------------

* Applied a little patch to make table browser in zope show system tables
  correctly. 

* Infinity values are now converted the correct way.

psycopg news for 1.0.4
----------------------

* ZPsycopgDA does not duplicate itself anymore.

* Table browsing works again.

psycopg news for 1.0.3
----------------------

* bugfix for b0rken ZPsycopgDA in 1.0.2.

psycopg news for 1.0.2
----------------------

* Fixed problem with incorrect interpretation of hundredths of a second.

psycopg news for 1.0.1
----------------------

* fixed two little memory leaks, see ChangeLog for details.

* fixed problem with garbled passwords when using crypt autentication.

psycopg news for 1.0
--------------------

* added regression tests, first result is much better conversion of date and
  time types.
  
* fixed last know segfault (psycopg runs stable for a lot of people now.)

* psycopg compile and run on FreeBSD and MacOS X.

* much better binary objects, they use less memory and quoting is faster,
  thank to the new, smarter memory allocator.
  
* fixed all reported buglets (mostly dbapi and type-system related.)

* hey, this is one-dot-oh!

* the following features are missing from psycopg 1.0 and will be added when
  we have a little more time (i.e., there will be no _feature_ releases after
  1.0, only bugfixes):

    - documentation is incomplete (we are slowly writing it, track CVS if you
      want up-to-date docs)

    - dbapi-2.0 testsuite is incomplete (need to move code to the unittest
      framework)

    - psycopg needs a full suite of regression tests to be sure we don't break
      things while implementing new features (i think we'll add them _while_
      writing new features :)

psycopg news for 0.99.7
-----------------------

* time intervals are correctly recognized and converted into DateTimeInterval 
  objects. 

* almost complete (bugs apart) DBAPI-2.0 support. switched psycopg to use
  QuotedString for every string passed as a bound argument. Binary now works 
  (but still consumes lots of memory).

* added doc/ to hold documentation.

* added lastoid() method to cursor objects, to retrieve the OID of the last 
  inserted row. 

psycopg news for 0.99.4
-----------------------

* psycopg is approaching 1.0, so only DBAPI compliance patches and bug fixes
  are getting in.

* added Binary and QuotedString objects. note that sometime before 1.0 we'll
  switch turn every string passed to psycopg into a QuotedString, possibily
  breaking Zope compatibility and old scripts doing their own quoting.

psycopg news for 0.5.x
----------------------

* this is the development branch, if you want stability, stick with 0.4.6.

* added pthread locks so that different threads (cursors) can use the same
  postgres connection (this was done *only* to respect the dbapi on cursor
  isolation.)

* now the default for the .cursor() method is to associate every cursor to
  the same physical connection, to avoid isolation (as the DBAPI-2.0 specify),
  you can change that by calling the .serialize() method on the connection and
  giving it 0 as the argument, e.g., "o.serialize(0)".

psycopg news for 0.4.1
----------------------

* autocommit mode is now supported on cursors and connections.

psycopg news for 0.4
--------------------

* implemented all the remaining DBAPI-2.0 type singletons (DATETIME and
  BINARY included)

psycopg news for 0.3
--------------------

* threading problems resolved

* added type casting from postgres to python (the user can now specify
  its own casting objects, the default singletons NUMBER and STRING are
  included [and act as default cast objects] plus INTEGER and FLOAT as
  an extension to the DBAPI-2.0.) 
  investigate the code in examples/usercast_test.py to understand how to
  add your own types...

* beginning of the Zope Database Adapter: give it a try even it it is 
  broken!
